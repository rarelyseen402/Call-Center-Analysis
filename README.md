### **Steps Involved**
1. Cleaned and organized raw call center data.
2. Used `pivot tables` for analyzing key metrics such as:
   - Calls volume by state
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Response times and reasons for calls
3. Added interactive slicers for filtering data dynamically.
4. Created a visual dashboard for easy interpretation of trends.
 
### **Tools and Skills Used**
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables and Charts
- Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Slicers and Interactive visuals

### **Files and Data Sources**
- Call Center CSV: The original dataset file I used in this project
- Call Center Dashboard xlsx: The `Excel` file Containing the interactive call center dashboard
- Dashboard png: The call center dashboard image in png format

### **Findings**
- A high portion of negative sentiment calls (52%), suggesting customer dissatisfaction.
- Certain states like `California` and `Texas` have higher call rates,requiring tailored & urgent solutions.
- Reccuring call reasons (`Billing Queries`) highlight common customer concerns.

### **Recommendations**
1. Implement targeted training for agents to address common negative feedback.
2. Focus resources on regions with high call rates for better customer engagement.
3. Analyze frequent call reasons to resolve root issues and improve customer satisfaction. i.e Adopt easier `Billing` options to reduce call traffic.
